# Facial_emotion_detection

We proposed a modified CoAtNet for emotion classification task. The proposed method outperformed the vanilla CoAtNet and other baseline models by close to 9% in terms of accuracy. Architecture modification was crucial,
demonstrating the neccesity of retaining fine-grain detail for such task. Temperature smoothing introduced additional benefits due to its ability to allow the model to quickly adjust the smoothness of the final probability distribution.
